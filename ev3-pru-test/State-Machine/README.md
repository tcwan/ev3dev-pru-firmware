# Quadrature Encoder State Machine

The [Quadrature Encoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder#Incremental_rotary_encoder) State Machine is defined using [Petri Net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net) notation to simplify the description.

However, it is not a pure Petri Net model, in the sense that Places and Transitions have associated actions that are executed when activated.

The `*.pn` file is created using [Snoopy](http://www-dssz.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/DSSZ/Software/Snoopy).
